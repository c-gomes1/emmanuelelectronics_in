        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>We’re Emmanuel Electronics and we’ve been manufacturing power conditioning equipment here
        in Mumbai, India since 1996. We’re staunch proponents of working by the 3 R’s of business
        (Reliability, Responsiveness &amp; Respect) and we strive to achieve perfection through the
        technology we create.</p>
        <p>Our company is ISO9001-2015 certified, and we are involved in the design &amp;
          development of a variety of products ranging from servo stabilizers to high-end frequency
          converters &amp; UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply). I started this business owing to my
          strong desire to create something new using the skills I have. I love challenging jobs and,
          together with my team, I constantly endeavor to provide reliable and user-friendly solutions
          to our customers’ needs.</p>
        <p>With the recent rise in solar renewable energy initiatives in India, we plan to expand
          our activities in this area within the next few years. We are also keen about entering the
          up-and-coming fields of IoT &amp; Artificial Intelligence.</p>
        <p>Our company believes in growth through long-term business relations with its clients. We
          understand that the best investment we can make is in the faith of our customers, which is
          why we provide quick &amp; accessible service in most of the major cities in the
          country.</p>
        <p>Feel free to get in touch with us to learn more about what we do!</p>
